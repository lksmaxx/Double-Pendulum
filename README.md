# Double-Pendulum
Double Pendulum with OpenGL compute shaders

First take on compute shaders with OpenGL and c++, focused on making it easily scalable.
I tested up to 500 pendulums at the same time on an RX 460 and I'm confident it can take more with better hardware.

That's it, after some minors, but tiresome challenges in learning CMake and library linking in C++ 
I'm pretty satisfied with the results and the beauty of chaos it can display.
